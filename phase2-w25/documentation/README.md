# Parser

This parser creates an abstract syntax tree, from a stream of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer. The parser supports binary and comparison operators. It also supports parentheses and different statement types such as if, while, repeat-until, print, and block. Some special features are also supported, such as block scoping and a factorial function. There is also built-in error handling.

## File Structure

- **parser.h**  
  Defines AST node structure and its types, also defines error types.

- **parser.c**  
  Implements the parser using the stream of tokens from lexer.c.

- **lexer.h**  
  Declares the functions for token generation and error reporting in the lexical analyzer.

- **lexer.c**  
  Implements the lexical analyzer, which tokenizes the input and identifies keywords, operators, and other syntax elements.

- **semantic.h**  
  Declares the symbol table structure and functions for semantic analysis.

- **semantic.c**  
  Implements semantic analysis, including variable declaration checks, type validation, and scope handling.

## Functions Overview

### Lexer Functions
- **`get_next_token`**  
  Reads the input and generates the next token, updating line and column numbers for error reporting.

- **`print_token`**  
  Prints the details of a token for debugging purposes.

- **`print_error`**  
  Reports lexical errors, such as invalid characters or consecutive operators.

### Parser Functions
- **`parser_init`**  
  Initializes the parser with the input source code.

- **`parse`**  
  Parses the input and constructs the abstract syntax tree (AST).

- **`print_ast`**  
  Prints the AST in a readable format for debugging.

- **`free_ast`**  
  Frees the memory allocated for the AST.

### Semantic Analysis Functions
- **`analyze_semantics`**  
  Performs semantic checks on the AST, such as variable declarations and type correctness.

- **`check_declaration`**  
  Validates variable declarations and adds them to the symbol table.

- **`check_assignment`**  
  Ensures variables are declared and initialized before assignment.

- **`check_expression`**  
  Validates expressions for type correctness and undeclared variables.

- **`check_block`**  
  Handles scope management for blocks of code.

- **`check_condition`**  
  Validates conditions in control statements like if and while.
