# Parser

This paraser creates an abstract byntax tree, from a stream of tokens generated by the lexical anaylzer. The parser supports binary and comparision operators. It also supports parentheses and different statement types such as if, while, repeat-until, print and block. Some special features are also supported such as block scoping and a factorial function. There is also in built error handling.

- **parser.h**  
  Defines AST node structure and its types, also defines error types.

- **parser.c**
